* Some basic Git commands for your reference

** git init

    Create a new repository

** git clone REPO

    Make a copy of a repository. A typical repository address is https://github.com/Grinnell-CSC195/hw1.

** git add FILE

    This can do one of two things. If FILE is not in the repository, it adds it to the repository. If FILE is already in the repository, it marks it as being part of the current set of files to be committed. (Often, you only want to commit only a subset of the files you've modified, so you use git add on each of those.)

** git status

    Get the status of your repository. What files have been modified? Which are staged for commit? Which are just new?

** git commit

    Commits all of the files you're added. Typically, pops up an editor. If vi pops up, use i to switch to insert mode, type the text for the commit, and then type the escape key to get out of insert mode. Then, type :wq to write the file and quit vi.

** git commit -m "MESSAGE"

    Commits the files you've added, using the given message. (A nice way to avoid the editor.)

** git log | less

    Shows a log of the changes that have been made. (less lets you page through those changes.)

** git push

    Send your commits to the primary repository.

** git pull

    Grab other people's commits from the primary repository.
